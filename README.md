# ADA-Project - Seasonal points of interest in Switzerland

##Abstract

The idea of our project is to find, based on social networks data, the seasonal points of interest in Switzerland. What we mean by *seasonal point of interest* is a place which experience a **regular and predictable** change of its interest through calendar year, likely to repeat each year.   

More concretely, we want to focus on places that generate interest according to natural conditions (temperature, weather, scenary, etc..) rather than events (Festival, exposition, etc..). 

##Data description 

We will mainly focus on Switzerland Instagram data, for various reason
* It is a very popular and active social network in Switzerland
* It is mainly based on photo/video sharing, which makes it interesting to represents nature interest of a place
* It encourages the users to geolocate the content they publish, hence the data contains a lot of geolocation helping for the development of this project

### Points location

We will use pictures/videos geolocation to establish the points of interests position. We may also use the hashtags in the pictures description that generally contains useful information about the location, for those who are not geolocated.

### Points interests

The interests of a place will be computed according to the number of "likes" and "share" its pictures got.
